# 🧠 AI Sentiment Analyzer
Welcome to the AI Sentiment Analyzer — a simple yet powerful web app that helps you understand the sentiment behind any sentence or message. Whether it's a product review, a tweet, or just your thoughts, this app analyzes the emotional tone using some of the best machine learning models available.

---

## ✨ What it Does
Just type a sentence like:

“This is amazing!” or “I hate rainy days”

Then hit Analyze Sentiment. The app uses three smart models to figure out if your input is positive, negative, or neutral:

✅ VADER

✅ BERT

✅ RoBERTa

You’ll also see a final “ensemble” result — a combination of all three — with a confidence score so you know how sure the AI is.

---

## 🚀 Why This is Cool
✅ Doesn’t rely on just one model — it uses three

🧠 Each model has its strengths:

VADER is great for short texts and social media

BERT and RoBERTa are powerful transformer models trained on large datasets

🎯 Clear results with sentiment and confidence score

🎨 Clean and modern UI that works great in the browser
